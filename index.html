                              <p> Hey, welcome to my first github-submitted website. It is mostly done so I can learn git/github, as well as all devoted stuff to that i.e. commits, pull requests, projects etc. This page is named "index.html" and it is meant to be a 2nd main page, including my bio...
                                 <br><br>
                                 About me: <br>
                                 I am 18 years old, Polish aspiring web developer. I'm also a huge Formula 1 fan, hence that is the reason why the website is so F1-themed. But I digress. My first meet with code is dated for around 2016, I was 13 years old at the time. Circumstances determined that I was/still am a gaming fan. That's exactly why I've started coding.
                                <br><br>
                                *That's how I look like* </p>
                              <img class="img-fluid pt-5 pb-5" src="img/photo-7.jpg" alt="Photo">
                              <p>My journey started with commonly-known game called "Little Fighter 2". Game has built a loyal community of fans, that I am a proud member of. That's where I met my mentor David G., recognized as "MangaD". He introduced me to the modding world of LF2, through that I've learned basics of XML.
                                 <br><br>
                                 With XML being my starting point, it didn't take long for me to move forward and code in HTML. Mentor of mine said it is a good introduction that every web dev needs to know. Since that moment onward, I'd use HTML daily. I've even done a course to certificate a tiny bit of my knowledge!
                              </p>
                              <img class="img-fluid pt-9 pb-9" src="img/photo-8.jpg" alt="Photo">

                                 <br><br>
                                 From that moment onwards, it went like a waterfall. Sometimes more actively, sometimes less, but I'd never forget about the code.
                              </p>
                              <p>With time passing by, I've started to use CSS in my websites, created a few apps using Ruby language (usable for RoR technology I guess), tried a lot of other languages, including Python and C#, and on top of that I've learnt a bit of Javascript so I could move my websites to the next level.
                                 <br><br>
                                 At the moment (16.06.2021) I'm still a student with 1 year of High School left. I'm learning new technologies (including Wordpress), doing personal projects and looking for challenges. Due to my circumstances, I can already tell I'll have a lot to do in near future (first commercial websites).
                                 <br><br>
                                 If you're curious how am I doing, make sure to visit my github @0xpako! There, you can find my social medias, LinkedIn profile and links to highlighted websites/projects. Cheers!
